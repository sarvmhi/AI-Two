        Processor

    ==================
    Module description
    ==================

    This module provides access to the preprocessor functionality of `CaDiCaL
    1.5.3 <https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical>`__. It can be used to
    process [1]_ (also see references therein) a given CNF formula and output
    a another formula, which is guaranteed to be *equisatisfiable* with the
    original formula. The processor can be invoked for a user-provided number
    of rounds. Also, the following preprocessing techniques can be used when
    running the processor:

    -  blocked clause elimination
    -  covered clause elimination
    -  globally-blocked clause elimination
    -  equivalent literal substitution
    -  bounded variable elimination
    -  failed literal probing
    -  hyper binary resolution
    -  clause subsumption
    -  clause vivification

    Note that the numerous parameters used in CaDiCaL for tweaking the
    preprocessor's behavior are currently unavailable here. (Default values
    are used.)

class Processor(object):

        This class provides interface to CaDiCaL's preprocessor. The only
        input parameter is ``bootstrap_with``, which is expected to be a
        :class:`.CNF` formula or a list (or iterable) of clauses.

        :param bootstrap_with: a list of clauses for processor initialization.
        :type bootstrap_with: :class:`.CNF` or iterable(iterable(int))

        Once created and used, a processor must be deleted with the
        :meth:`delete` method. Alternatively, if created using the ``with``
        statement, deletion is done automatically when the end of the ``with``
        block is reached. It is *important* to keep the processor if a user
        wants to restore a model of the original formula.

        The main methods of this class are :meth:`process` and
        :meth:`restore`. The former calls CaDiCaL's preprocessor while the
        latter can be used to reconstruct a model of the original formula
        given a model for the processed formula as illustrated below.

        Note how keeping the :class:`Processor` object is needed for model
        restoration. (If it is deleted, the information needed for model
        reconstruction is lost.)

            are set as in the default configuration of CaDiCaL 1.5.3.

            As the result, the method returns a :class:`.CNF` object
            containing the processed formula. Additionally to the clauses, the

            It is important to note that activation of some of the
            preprocessing techniques conditionally depends on the activation
            of other preprocessing techniques. For instance, subsumed, blocked
            and covered clause elimination is invoked only if bounded variable
            elimination is active. Subsumption elimination in turn may trigger
            vivification and transitive reduction if the corresponding flags
